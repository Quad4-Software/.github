# Developing Skiptrace Intelligence Platform

Skiptrace is a next-generation intelligence platform integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS), collaborative team tools, and a comprehensive suite of features to support ethical investigations, research, and intelligence gathering.  Built for the financial sector, private investigators, and intelligence professionals, Skiptrace provides critical information and streamlines workflows.

What makes Skiptrace unique is its ability to operate on-premise on inexpensive hardware such as a single Raspberry Pi 5.  It also features advanced security and auditing to meet the strictest compliance and operational security (OPSEC) standards.
