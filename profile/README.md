# Developing Skiptrace Intelligence and Situational Awareness Platform

Skiptrace is a next-generation decentralized intelligence and situational awareness platform integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS), collaborative team tools, and a comprehensive suite of features to support ethical investigations, research, and intelligence gathering.  Built for the financial sector, private investigators, and intelligence professionals, Skiptrace provides critical information and streamlines workflows. We leverage the Reticulum Network Stack to create a fully decentralized platform, where users can collaborate and share resources or intel securely. 

The platform can support both online and offline environments. It can leverage proxy nodes over the Reticulum Network hosted by Quad4 or you can setup your own proxy nodes. What makes Skiptrace more unique is its ability to operate on-premise on inexpensive hardware such as a single Raspberry Pi 5, it can also utilize older hardware for smaller software componenets.  It features advanced platform security, permissions and auditing to meet the strictest compliance and operational security (OPSEC) standards.

We prioritize business with vetted clients and teams to ensure responsible and ethical application of our platforms and tools.
